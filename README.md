I have built an E-Catalog Dashboard to manage products and monitor sales activity easily.It gives a quick summary of all important business activities in one place.
-Total Products
    This section shows how many products are currently available in the system. It helps the admin know the size of the product catalog.
-Total Sales
    This displays the total number of items sold so far. It updates automatically whenever a new sale is added.
-Total Revenue
    This shows the total money earned from all sales. The amount is calculated by adding the prices of all sold products.
-Total Orders
    This indicates how many orders have been placed in total. Each order may contain one or more products.
-Top Product
    This shows the product that has been sold the most. It helps identify the best-performing item.
Navigation Menu (Left Side)
    Dashboard – Shows the overall summary and statistics
    Products – Used to view, add, update, or delete products
    Add Sale – Used to record a new sales transaction
    Top Sellers – Displays products with the highest sales
    Invoice – Generates and displays invoices for customer orders
For this project i used:
    Frontend:Html,css,bootstrap,javasctript
    Backend:PHP
To run:http://localhost/folder_name/index.php or http://localhost/folder_name
In db.php we have to change the db name to what we have given the database name in sql where both should match each other.
