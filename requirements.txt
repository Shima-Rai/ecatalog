Steps:
Download from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
Install it in C:\xampp (Windows) or /Applications/XAMPP (macOS)
Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel
when u click on admin in mysql it goes to mysql where we have to create a database

1.PHP Requirements
    Your code uses PHP 7.4+ or PHP 8.x, which comes bundled with XAMPP.
    Make sure php.ini allows:
    mysqli extension (for database)
    son extension (for API JSON responses)
    PHP CLI (optional, for running scripts from terminal) is included in XAMPP.
️
2.MySQL Requirements
    Your project uses a MySQL database. XAMPP provides it.
    You can use phpMyAdmin to:
    Create database (ecommerce or similar)
    Create tables (products, orders)
    Manage data visually

3.VS Code Requirements
    VS Code is your IDE for coding HTML, CSS, JS, PHP.
    Recommended Extensions:
        PHP Intelephense → PHP autocompletion & error checking
        PHP Server → Run PHP server without XAMPP if needed
        Live Server → For front-end preview (HTML/CSS/JS only)
        Prettier – Code Formatter → Auto-format code
        Bootstrap 5 Snippets → Faster front-end dev
        HTML CSS Support → Auto-complete for front-end
    VS Code Settings:
        Set default encoding to UTF-8
        Enable format on save for better readability

4.project Setup
    Place your project inside C:\xampp\htdocs\your_project (Windows)
    Access in browser: http://localhost/your_project
    Database connection in db.php should point to:
        $conn = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "your_db_name");

✅ Summary:
You just need:
    XAMPP (with Apache + MySQL + PHP 8.x)
    VS Code with PHP + front-end extensions
    Database setup in phpMyAdmin
    CDNs included for Bootstrap, fonts, charts
